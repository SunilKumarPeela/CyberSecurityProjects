  relevant frameworks, and addressing any outstanding compliance-related issues.

  Task 1: Finding vulnerabilities in the Security Command Center 
  
  *Navigated to the Security Command Center and accessed the Active Vulnerabilities section.
  *Used the "Findings By Resource Type" filter to sort active vulnerabilities by resource.
  *Focused on three cloud resource types with vulnerabilities that needed remediation:
Cloud storage bucket
Compute Instance virtual machine (VM)
Firewall
Reviewed the details of the PCI DSS 3.2.1 report in the Compliance section.
Identified the rules that were non-compliant with PCI DSS, which corresponded to the vulnerabilities in the bucket, VM, and firewall.
Focused on remediating these vulnerabilities in the subsequent tasks and challenges.

  Task 2:
