<h1> Security Blue Team Capstone Project - Threat Hunting</h1>

>*You are a Junior Threat Hunter working for an organisation. Your Threat Intelligence team has obtained two malware samples, but they’re too busy dealing with a data breach dump that includes employee credentials, so you’ll need to hunt for any presence of the malware in any systems. As you’re new to the role, the Senior Threat Hunter is using advanced tools to assess all systems company-wide, but he has given you permission to run a live hunt on one system. A disk image was taken, as the system is in a remote office. You have been told to gather your own IOCs from two malware samples, and conduct a hunt on the files using Mandiant IOC Editor and Mandiant Redline. You are to report on the findings generated by the IOC Reports.*

<h1> Elastic SIEM LAB</h1>

>*Engineered a full SIEM setup using Elastic Stack to detect network scans from Kali Linux via Nmap. Installed and configured Elastic Agents to capture real-time telemetry logs from virtual environments. Designed custom dashboards and visualizations to monitor suspicious patterns and behavior anomalies. Created and tested automated alert rules that email notifications on identified attack signatures. Demonstrates advanced hands-on skills in threat hunting, log analysis, and real-time security monitoring..*

<h1>Valdorian Times Cybersecurity Breach: A Real-World SOC Investigation </h1>

>*This project showcases a realistic cybersecurity investigation of a breach at the fictional Valdorian Times newsroom. Leveraging KQL, passive DNS analysis, process telemetry, and endpoint forensics, the case tracks a spear-phishing attack that escalates into document forgery, credential abuse, and data exfiltration. Designed for SOC analysts and cybersecurity learners, it offers a hands-on, narrative-driven experience to simulate real-world incident response.*

<h1> Cyber Espionage SOC</h1>

>*This repository showcases an in-depth forensic investigation into a simulated cyber breach of TitanShield’s highly classified initiative, Project Omega—a next-gen autonomous AI defense platform. What initially appeared to be a harmless download of a tank-themed game, DeTankWar, quickly escalated into a covert espionage operation orchestrated by the North Korean APT group Moonstone Sleet. Leveraging phishing attacks, weaponized game files, and command-and-control infrastructure, the attackers successfully compromised a secure environment, staged critical data, and exfiltrated it via FTP. Through detailed KQL-based threat hunting and Microsoft Defender XDR-style analysis, this case study unravels the full attack sequence—highlighting how a single click can compromise even the most fortified networks. Whether you're a SOC analyst, red team operator, or cybersecurity enthusiast, this repository offers both a hands-on learning experience and a gripping look into the tactics of modern cyber warfare.*
