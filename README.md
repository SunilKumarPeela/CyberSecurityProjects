<h1>Google Cloud Capstone Project</h1>

> Cymbal Retail, a retail giant with 170 physical stores and an online platform across 28 countries, generating $15 billion in revenue, recently experienced a data breach. As a junior member of the security team, 
  I have been tasked with identifying the vulnerabilities related to the breach, isolating and containing it to prevent further unauthorized access, recovering the compromised systems, verifying compliance with 
  relevant frameworks, and addressing any outstanding compliance-related issues.

  Task 1: Finding vulnerabilities in the Security Command Center 
  >  I navigated to the **Security Command Center** and accessed the **Active Vulnerabilities** section. Once there, I used the "**Findings By Resource Type**" filter to sort the active vulnerabilities by 
     resource. I focused on three cloud resource types with vulnerabilities that needed remediation: the **Cloud storage bucket**, **the Compute Instance virtual machine (VM)**, and the **firewall**.

  > Next, I went to the **Compliance section** to review the details of the **PCI DSS 3.2.1** report. I identified the rules that were non-compliant with PCI DSS, which corresponded to the vulnerabilities in the bucket, 
    VM, and firewall. Remediating these vulnerabilities was my primary focus in the subsequent tasks and challenges. <span style="color: #00D5E4;">Success</span>
